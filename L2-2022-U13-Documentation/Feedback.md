The phone pages look really good, could use the edges being bezeled (rounded).
The phone sites could have a logo button to go back instead of a text link. Some phones could be fixed as the text changes and not continues. Some phones are missing text and information. Overall, looks really nice, simple layout and colours go well. Very easy to find a phone of liking.

its really nice. You have a nice selection of phones and you have their prices tags specs and everything. But I would reccomend you to add a buy button on each phone page. You have a nice logo in a nice colour. I like the colours on the website but because it matches some of the phones on the front page. I think it would look better if you added more context on the pages with the individual phones but apart from that its nice.

the design looks very good, good use of images and nice ideas for the phone pages could use a buy button but its still a good design, everything fuctions perfectly. overall a briliant peice of work.
