### Design #1 is based of 'A Tropical Forest' theme, same with Design #2 has been based of 'Halloween and Nightmare' theme.
#
## FINAL DECISION -
### Reason for choosing Design #1 is that it has a wider range of contrast, plus it fits with the logo, and the text (the text is going be *black* colour, so it will be easier to see and read), plus it was *kind of* confirmed by a peer who gave the statement told that the Design #1 is giving him vibe, then Design #2, and Design #1 is useful for people with colour blindess, because they can see the colours that Design #1 is provoding.

## PEERS STATEMENT -
### Adam : i quite like design 1 as that to me suits the vibe of the website more then design 2

# WEBSITE LAYOUT

## DESIGN #1
<img src="IMG/Non-Colour-Website-Design.png">

## DESIGN #2
<img src="IMG/Non-Colour-Alternative-Website-Design.png">

+ ### For Design #1 I decided to use grid layout, on the left side there's going be a phone image, and with it *small* information about phone, then on the right side there's going be another grid layout for each boxes there's going be phone images, and the prices, plus a *gif* banner. At the bottom there's going be 'About us' text and hyperlinks, then at very bottom, left side there's going be copyright text. At the top, left side there's going be company logo.
+ ### For Design #2 I decided to use grid layout, on the left side there's going be carousel and inside there going be bunch of phones images with the hyperlinks, then on the right side there's going be another grid layout, but this time it's going be images of phone brands with the hyperlinks. At the bottom, left side "Abut us" with a text and hyperlinks, then at right side the regular banner, at the very bottom left side copyright text. A the top , middle there's going be company logo.

#

## FINAL DECISION
### Reason of choosing Design #1 is that fits with my requirements, and for people who going to see it, cause it easier to find everything, plus each of those phones images are going be linked, so no need to research the phone, then Design #2 it has a lot of trouble making, and it will be hard to use for people who will seeing it.

# TYPOGRAPHY

## Font Design #1
### UBUNTU (Regular 400)
<img src="IMG/Font-Design-1.png">

## Font Design #2
### ROBOTO SLAB (Light 300)
<img src="IMG/Font-Design-2.png">

## FINAL DECISION
### Reason of choosing Font Design #1 is that I used to seeing this font in every single sites, shops, and in the games, it has similar with the default font text, but what's the difference from default to "UBUNTU" is that "f", "e", "d" and "a" has been arounded and understandable.

#

# LOGO DESIGN

### This logo has been made by myself by using photoshop.
<img src="IMG/Logo-Design-1.png">

#

# ALTERNATIVE DESIGN

### For alternative design, I will be more less creative, but still I will make new design of colour scheme, I will use Design #2 of Website Layout section, and I will use the same logo, but in the different colour (The colour will be similar to new colour scheme desgin).

## COLOUR SCHEME
<img src="IMG/Alternative-Design.png">

HEX CODES:
+ .color-primary-0 { color: #BB8438 }
+ .color-primary-1 { color: #FF9400 }
+ .color-primary-2 { color: #FFB754 }
+ .color-primary-3 { color: #C67300 }
+ .color-primary-4 { color: #8C5100 }

+ .color-complement-0 { color: #C8B929 }
+ .color-complement-1 { color: #A79800 }
+ .color-complement-2 { color: #FFE800 }
+ .color-complement-3 { color: #FFF058 }
+ .color-complement-4 { color: #FAEF81 }

### I made that colour-scheme as my alternative is because it's based of Egypt theme, and I like bright colours, so that's why I used brown and yellow colours. #FF9400 colour I will use for my Top bar & Bottom bar, #FFE800 I will use that colour as for my background, #BB8438 colour I will use for my box in grid layout, then #FAEF81 colour I will use for my other box in the left side, and 3 of the boxes that contian in grid layout. At very bottom bar I will use #C67300 colour.

# THIRD-PARTYING REVIEW OF FINISHED PRODUCT

## Aiden
The phone pages look really good, could use the edges being bezeled (rounded).
The phone sites could have a logo button to go back instead of a text link. Some phones could be fixed as the text changes and not continues. Some phones are missing text and information. Overall, looks really nice, simple layout and colours go well. Very easy to find a phone of liking.
## Ashley
its really nice. You have a nice selection of phones and you have their prices tags specs and everything. But I would reccomend you to add a buy button on each phone page. You have a nice logo in a nice colour. I like the colours on the website but because it matches some of the phones on the front page. I think it would look better if you added more context on the pages with the individual phones but apart from that its nice.
## daine
the design looks very good, good use of images and nice ideas for the phone pages could use a buy button but its still a good design, everything fuctions perfectly. overall a briliant peice of work.

## ALL FEEDBACK LISTED

+ Add logo button, instead of a text link (It will be added in the new version)
+ Missing text and information on some phones pages (It will be added in the new version)
+  Add buy button (It will be added in the new version)

# EVALUATE

I have reviewed my own website and it suitable to people who's looking for phones or accessories for their phones, and it's colourful that's good for people who has colour blindness, plus some phones having a lot of information about it.
